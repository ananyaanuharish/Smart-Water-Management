# Smart Water Management System using AI

## Overview
The **Smart Water Management System using AI** is designed to optimize water usage by monitoring soil moisture, water tank levels, and detecting leaks. The system utilizes IoT sensors and AI-based decision-making to automate water distribution efficiently. It is integrated with the **BlynkIoT app** for real-time monitoring and remote control.

## Features
- **Moisture Sensor**: Detects if soil is wet or dry.
- **Water Level Sensor**: Identifies whether the tank is full or empty.
- **Water Leakage Detector**: Detects any leakage in the system.
- **Mini Water Pump**: Automatically turns on/off based on sensor readings.
- **BlynkIoT Integration**: Enables real-time monitoring and control via a mobile app.
- **AI Optimization**: Uses AI algorithms to optimize water usage based on sensor data.

## Tech Stack
- **Hardware**: Arduino/ESP8266/ESP32, Moisture Sensor, Water Level Sensor, Water Leakage Sensor, Relay Module, Mini Water Pump
- **Software**: Arduino IDE, C++, Python (for AI processing)
- **IoT Platform**: BlynkIoT
- **Cloud & Connectivity**: Wi-Fi Module (ESP8266/ESP32), MQTT Protocol

## System Architecture
1. Sensors collect real-time data on soil moisture, water levels, and leakage.
2. The microcontroller processes this data and makes decisions using AI algorithms.
3. The water pump is activated or deactivated based on AI-driven logic.
4. Sensor readings and system status are updated on the BlynkIoT app for remote monitoring.

## Installation & Setup
1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/smart-water-ai.git
   ```
2. Install dependencies and libraries:
   - **Arduino Libraries**: Blynk, WiFi, DHT, LiquidCrystal_I2C, Servo
3. Connect sensors and microcontroller as per the circuit diagram.
4. Upload the Arduino code to the microcontroller using the Arduino IDE.
5. Configure the **BlynkIoT app** with the provided authentication token.
6. Run the system and monitor real-time data on the Blynk dashboard.

## Expected Output
- The system detects moisture levels, water tank status, and leaks in real time.
- The water pump operates automatically based on AI-driven decisions.
- Users receive real-time updates and can control the system remotely via the BlynkIoT app.

## Advantages
